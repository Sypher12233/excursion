# First of all: What is a pull-request.

When you work on a project feature on your own branch and push it after you have finished.
Your work will not be added to the main branch until it has been reviewed.
After being reviewed and accepted it will be added to the main branch.

> A ***pull request*** is a feature of source code management tools to review code before adding it to the main branch.

* When you create a pull request, your repository is automatically set as the source and the project's repo is set as the destination.
* You will get the option to set the source and destination branch. You will be greeted with a preview of changes and whether or not the two codebases can be automatically depending on the code conflicts.

> In the pull request description
you must specify what features will your code add to the project. 

## Now how to make a good pull request.

* follow the pull request structure: WHAT, WHY and HOW?

Concisely explain the purpose of the pull request in the title. If the pull request adds a new feature, go for something like “Add frontend component for settings page”. If it’s to fix a typo, be specific and say “Fix name typos on the Contact Us page”.

The description is where all the juicy details are. You want the reviewers to know the thought process behind code changes and the options you have considered. It also helps to embed screenshots, GIFs, or even videos of your application so reviewers can anticipate what the code change in the pull request looks like.
